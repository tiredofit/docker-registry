## Prerequisites and Assumptions
*  Assumes you are using some sort of SSL terminating reverse proxy such as:
   *  [Traefik](https://github.com/tiredofit/docker-traefik)
   *  [Nginx](https://github.com/jc21/nginx-proxy-manager)
   *  [Caddy](https://github.com/caddyserver/caddy)

## Installation
### Build from Source
Clone this repository and build the image with `docker build -t (imagename) .`

### Prebuilt Images
Builds of the image are available on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/tiredofit/registry)

```bash
docker pull docker.io/tiredofdit/registry:(imagetag)
```

Builds of the image are also available on the [Github Container Registry](https://github.com/tiredofit/docker-registry/pkgs/container/docker-registry) 
 
```
docker pull ghcr.io/tiredofit/docker-registry/pkgs/container/docker-registry):(imagetag)
``` 

The following image tags are available along with their tagged release based on what's written in the [Changelog](CHANGELOG.md):

| Container OS | Tag       |
| ------------ | --------- |
| Alpine       | `:latest` |

#### Multi Architecture
Images are built primarily for `amd64` architecture, and may also include builds for `arm/v7`, `arm64` and others. These variants are all unsupported. Consider [sponsoring](https://github.com/sponsors/tiredofit) my work so that I can work with various hardware. To see if this image supports multiple architecures, type `docker manifest (image):(tag)`

## Configuration

### Quick Start

* The quickest way to get started is using [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/). See the examples folder for a working [docker-compose.yml](examples/docker-compose.yml) that can be modified for development or production use.

* Set various [environment variables](#environment-variables) to understand the capabiltiies of this image.
* Map [persistent storage](#data-volumes) for access to configuration and data files for backup.

> **NOTE**: If you are using this with a docker-compose file along with a seperate SQL container, take care not to set the variables to backup immediately, more so have it delay execution for a minute, otherwise you will get a failed first backup.
### Persistent Storage

The following directories are used for configuration and can be mapped for persistent storage.

| Directory           | Description     |
| ------------------- | --------------- |
| `/var/lib/registry` | Images          |
| `/logs/`            | Logs (Optional) |

### Environment Variables

#### Base Images used

This image relies on an [Alpine Linux](https://hub.docker.com/r/tiredofit/alpine) base image that relies on an [init system](https://github.com/just-containers/s6-overlay) for added capabilities. Outgoing SMTP capabilities are handlded via `msmtp`. Individual container performance monitoring is performed by [zabbix-agent](https://zabbix.org). Additional tools include: `bash`,`curl`,`less`,`logrotate`, `nano`,`vim`.

Be sure to view the following repositories to understand all the customizable options:

| Image                                                  | Description                            |
| ------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------- |
| [OS Base](https://github.com/tiredofit/docker-alpine/) | Customized Image based on Alpine Linux |


| Directory  | Description                      | Default        |
| ---------- | -------------------------------- | -------------- |
| `LOG_TYPE` | Logging type `FILE` or `CONSOLE` | `FILE`         |
| `LOG_PATH` | Log Path                         | `/logs/`       |
| `LOG_FILE` | Log Filename                     | `registry.log` |

### Networking

The following ports are exposed.

| Port   | Description |
| ------ | ----------- |
| `5000` | Registry    |


## Maintenance


### Shell Access

For debugging and maintenance purposes you may want access the containers shell.

``bash
docker exec -it (whatever your container name is) bash
``
## Support

These images were built to serve a specific need in a production environment and gradually have had more functionality added based on requests from the community.
### Usage
- The [Discussions board](../../discussions) is a great place for working with the community on tips and tricks of using this image.
- Consider [sponsoring me](https://github.com/sponsors/tiredofit) for personalized support
### Bugfixes
- Please, submit a [Bug Report](issues/new) if something isn't working as expected. I'll do my best to issue a fix in short order.

### Feature Requests
- Feel free to submit a feature request, however there is no guarantee that it will be added, or at what timeline.
- Consider [sponsoring me](https://github.com/sponsors/tiredofit) regarding development of features.

### Updates
- Best effort to track upstream changes, More priority if I am actively using the image in a production environment.
- Consider [sponsoring me](https://github.com/sponsors/tiredofit) for up to date releases.
